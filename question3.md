The University is experimenting with different parking lot layouts. Their latest idea is to create a single parking lot which consists of a single row of end-to-end spaces (better starting practising your parallel parking skills!). The parking lot will be divided into uniformly sized sections known as **blocks**. After some careful observation, it was noted that the smallest car at the University will require 3 blocks, and in order to reduce the number of fender benders at **least** one empty block must be present between any two cars.

Given these constraints, it can be seen that a 7 block parking lot can have 17 different car configurations, depicted below:

_* Note that the maximum length of a car is unbounded, and there can be a combination of different length cars per lot._

Given the length of a parking lot, determine the number of different car configurations.

### Input Format

*   A single integer `N` in [3, 50] representing the total number of blocks in the parking lot

### Output Format

*   An integer denoting the number of valid car configurations
